                <h3 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> MY TECH JOURNEY.</h3>
                <P>My tech journey started at ITSkillsCenter, where I took Full Stack Web development as a course.
                    Starting off as a complete beginner was challeging
                    I started with <i>"HTML"</i>
                <p>It is the building block of all websites.</p>
                It is the foundation upon which every content on a webpage is structured. HTML contains numerous tags
                in which I'm still learning and indeed it's fun and verrrrry broad .
                <p>Being around a lot of beginners like myself indeed encourages me, but what's most fascinating is
                    having experienced and expert tutors that ensure we understand what we are been taught.</p>
                We are been drilled and allowed to face the practical aspect of the field , not been spoonfed which
                grooms us to taing bold steps and emerging succesful in the field.
                <p>Indeed ITSkills Center is the map to my success journey and I'm proud to start off the journey with
                    the best roadmap.</p>
                <p>Be informed , my success story has officially begun....</p>
